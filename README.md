	The aim of this Monopoly Game project is to create a Java based object oriented implementation of the Monopoly game. The game will run as a simulation and print the necessary information as an output on the terminal.
In this step there is one player that has a pawn on board. The board has 40 squares on it. There are Start Square, Park Square, Province Squares, Management Squares, Station Squares,Tax Squares, Public Fund Squares, Chance Squares,  two Jail Squares.

If he/she finishes a tour on board and passes the Start Square, then earns 200$. The game finishes when there is only one player.
